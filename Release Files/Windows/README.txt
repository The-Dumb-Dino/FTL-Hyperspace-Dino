This mod DOES NOT WORK with the latest version of FTL. You will need to downgrade your FTL to 1.6.9 to be able to use it. The instructions to do that are below.

==============
 Installation
==============

= Windows =

Extract the files in the "Windows - Extract these files into where FTLGame.exe is" in your FTL directory.
This is usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FTL Faster Than Light.

Steam: Run the downgrade.bat included with the Hyperspace download.
Other versions: Download the appropriate downgrader for your build from the forum post, copy it to your FTL directory and run it.

(NOTE: Installing Hyperspace.ftl is NOT necessary for FTL: Multiverse)
Install the "Hyperspace.ftl" mod with Slipstream Mod Manager, along with any other mods that utilize Hyperspace after that.

= Uninstalling =

To uninstall, simply delete the "Hyperspace.dll" file from your FTL directory, where you installed the mod.

To revert back to 1.6.14, in your FTL directory, delete FTLGame.exe and rename FTLGame_orig.exe to FTLGame.exe.
Just removing the mod from Slipstream will NOT remove the entire mod.

============
 Mod Makers
============

Most of the features that you can use from Hyperspace are documented in data/hyperspace.xml in Hyperspace.ftl.
Use a hyperspace.xml.append and add the xml tags you need for your mod.
Ideally, the user would download Hyperspace as well as your mod, and install Hyperspace.ftl first then your mod.
For maximum compatibility with other mods, don't redistribute the Hyperspace resource files and instead just direct the user to download Hyperspace in your forum post.
