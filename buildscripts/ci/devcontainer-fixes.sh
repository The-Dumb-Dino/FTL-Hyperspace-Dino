# This script applies fixes to a bug caused by a x86-windows-ftl.cmake triplet or/and toolchain.
# For some reason only boost_atomic library is being built with .lib naming instead of .a like all other boost libs.
# This causes linking errors when boost-filesystem (which depends on boost-atomic) is used in a MinGW build.
# As a workaround, we manually copy boost_atomic.lib to libboost

# Try to install all packages to both Windows build directories
# boost-filesystem will fail due to boost-atomic lib naming, that's expected
